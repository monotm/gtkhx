Installation Instructions for GtkHx
==========================================
1. './configure'
2. '[g]make' (use gmake if you are on a non-GNU system)
3. '[g]make install'

If you do not have root access, GtkHx can be put anywhere, as well as
icons.rsrc.  Just make sure you have the correct path set to icons.rsrc
in the GtkHx preferences.
